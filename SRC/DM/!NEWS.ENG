2News of particular versions0


e1-3.52-0a

		+ higher compatibility to old projects made by version 0.xx
		+ avoids bugs in Cirrus Logic GD-54xx
		+ dm ? prints commandline-help in your language


e1-3.51-0a

		+ Sometimes it's not possible to know if graphics card driver is
		  still buggy (and will eventually crash machine) or is fixed. So
		  there is new option in setup - ability to use bonly safe modesa
		  (=assume that driver is bad). With fixed drivers it's possible
		  to turn this behaviour off in setup (F2). Now it affects
		  . Matrox (VESA modes (SVGA) are not safe)
		  . NVidia Detonator (VGA modes are not safe)
		  . 3DFx/Banshee (low VESA resolutions are not safe)
		+ beter prepared for viewing old projects (version 0.xx)
		  . fixed font styles (inside texture, transparent etc)
		  . doesn't bother with small problems on single pages
		  . just warns several times that viewing is not safe
		+ better prepared for viewing many projects at once
		  . loads 100 projects at once
		  . when name doesn't fit into button, shows its right end
		+ menu is closeable by left button, on title page also openable
		+ RAIN 1.5
		  . in DOS without soundcard runs Machina without RAIN
		    (=Machina has more memory)
		  . in Windows without soundcard too, no more complaining about
		    "Device busy"
		+ more Windows support
		  . Machina is distributed also as Windows installer
		  . it's first time in history Machina could be uninstalled :)
		  . added .pif files for smoother start under Windows
		  . with dm.pif machina.exe was removed as obsolete


e1-3.50-0a

		+ picture buttons (may be turned off in setup)
		+ faster machine (photo) (old one stays in safe mode)
		+ sexy 4KB chiptune inside doc
		+ new fonts in editor support (see page doc/editor)
		+ tiny changes (+1 button in menu)
		+ bugfixes (blackpixels in 256color, bug at shutdown,
		   layer rehook in editor)


e1-3.20-0a

		+ switches console to fullscreen under Windows to get access
		  to VBE modes
		+ enhanced Parlan (new eventGet(), new scripts ripf.scr and
		  ripexec.scr included, small bugfixes)
		+ another buggy Banshee supported (Machina avoids its bugs)


e1-3.12-0a

		+ MP3s with WAV header spread like plague, so new RAIN
		  servers 1.4 play them too
		+ DM.INI contains new variable StaticMode (if set, it says:
		  Machina Machina, don't change mode, use just this one)
		+ but when Machina does select mode, it shouldn't crash
		  anymore as it did due to bad guess which bitdepth fits into
		  available memory
		+ pages edited by hand like RT70 title are allowed now
		+ warning 'Shortening text' on pages edited by hand or
		  converted from version 1.xx appears only with DumbMode=no


e1-3.11-0a

		+ file for immediate open entered on commandline is searched
		  in whole dirlist (in all important directories)
		

e1-3.10-0a

		+ creating your own projects is easier
		  . script parameters up to 64KB long
		  . support package for editor contains script menu.scr, which
		    shows your questions to user and makes actions depending
		    on answers, actions like message, sound, anim, music, jump
		    to page, another question...
		  . small Parlan change (cutChar returns string)
		+ bugfixes (link to animation)
		

e1-3.05-0a

		+ runs even in Windows NT/2000 with their tragically incorrect
		  emulation of DOS mouse
		- worse mouse behaviour in DOSemu window in Linuxu (due to
		  Windows NT/2000 support), I suggest staying with version 3.04
		  or running in fullscreen
		+ mouse sensitivity setting has wider range
		+ if Windows NT bothered you with many "no floppy disc in A:"
		  messages, expect no more than one message now
		+ RAIN servers in version 1.3
		  . play even MP3 with ID3 header
		  . Machina w/o RAIN is offered when both together don't run


e1-3.04-0a

		+ just small changes and fixes (eg. large menus are able
		  to scroll up and down)... btw it showed that only older
		  Windows support windowed scrolling and only 320x200/8.
		  But Machina can run windowed in any resolution and any
		  depth... where? In DOSemu under Linux.


e1-3.03-0a

		+ just for fun: Machina can live also in Windows window (how to
		  do it? go to setup, turn IRQ2 off, set up 320x200/8 and
		  turn automatic modechange off (or run Machina with
		  parameters vga x=320 y=200) and press Alt-Enter)


e1-3.02-0a

		+ new RAIN 1.2 uses DirectSound in Windows (you can disable it
		  in RAIN config in case of troubles) and has higher priority
		? ok...it was false alarm around IRQ2 and clock, turn them on if
		  you want smoother scrolling. mousehandler was that Windows
		  killer. it's Borland's, Microsoft's or mouse driver's bug,
		  everything I can do I have already done, mousehandler is
		  optional since 3.01
		+ amplification value is shown during its adjustments (+,-)


e1-3.01-0a

		+ something from previously gloriously announced IRQ2 and
		  precise clock may be source of headache to some Windows,
		  therefore both is turned off by default now. you may turn it
		  on again (which I advise) in setup or dm.ini
		+ also mousehandler is turned off and I advise to turn it on.
		  I have seen one computer, that occasionally crashed with
		  mousehandler (probably bug in its mouse driver)
		+ lower consumption in some cases and better behaviour when
		  low on memory (but everything is limited by Borlands buggy
		  memory manager)


e1-3.00-0a

		d[audio]a
		+ new audiosystem RAIN
		  . plays on any soundcard with Windows driver
		  . but still plays also in DOS via GUS/SB/PAS/WSS
		  . plays MOD, S3M, XM, (IT), WAV, MP3
		  . 16bit stereo + interpolation
		  . not needed, but may be configured by "rain -c"
		  . dee.cz/rain
		+ new music menu under F8
		  . it's possible to play all modules and mp3 from your directory
		  . alphabetical or random order
		  . automatic switch after end or x minutes
		  . play previous, next or random module/mp3
		? previously used keys F9, F10 and F11 are free now
		+ plus and minus on numpad control amplifier
		+ music sample plays always just one and its volume is
		  controlled by Machina music volume (so by keys 1..0)
		+ clicking on module plays it once and then returns old music
		+ completely new default sounds; I hope you like them
		d[scrolling]a
		+ new methods how to reach smooth scroling even in Windows
		  or in another inhospitable lands, during playing MP3 or so
		  . IRQ2 generated by graphics card
		  . microsecond precise clock
		d[misc]a
		+ new setup with lots of stuff (F2 or button Setup)
		  . lots of stuff
		  . and things
		+ support package for editor contains also
		  . FNED version 1999/10/17
		  . some new fonts
		? lang.cz and lang.eng were packed into dm.exe -> less files,
		  but users can't add new languages from now
		+ prevents another buggy VBE on Voodoo3 from crashing
		+ small things like: fileselectors at editor startup and at
		  searching your music starts where they finished last time
		+ authors may recommend viewing resolution to each picture
		  in slideshow
		+ mothership reconnected from scene.org to scene.cz, old
		  mothership is not even a bit broncsy as you can see from
		  true story that happened: I filled up an apply form, attached
		  we r0mb ya dont (true art), realtime radiosity (true art) and
		  fuck you (true art) and they haven't even replied, ugly little
		  dwarfz. so secret of life is now at broncs.scene.cz


e1-2.40-0a

		+ prepared for soundsystem change in version 3.00, binary
		  compatibility will stay until 3.09, later created projects
		  can't be viewed by 2.40.
		? some change that make scrolling on Cirrus Logic 5436/46
		  smoother (tell me if it gets worse on other cord)
		+ preserves buggy VBE on Banshee before crash
		+ bugfixes
		  . HTML export of pages with many emails and http addr.
		  . dlgMenu in Parlanu

		+ much better support for Czech and Slovak languages
		  (details in cCzech version!news.cza)
		+ bitdepth autoselection now looks also on amount of system
		  memory, expect less ends due to low memory
		+ 4 and 16 color PNG support
		+ runs also on systems without retrace and system clock
		+ support package for editor contains also
		  . voting sheets processor with source code
		+ under Y2k hype I checked what Machina does with date
		  and with pleasure in my heart I can say, that first
		  problems (caused by filesystemem FAT, not Machina)
		  may appear in 2100
		+ bugfixes

e1-2.00-0a

	This is the first international version so only brief featurelist follows. To see some history, you can have a look at the cCzech version!news.cza of this page.

		dunique graphics enginea
		  . scrolls smoothly when it is technically possible
		    using four different methods
		  . supports all textmodes and all 8,15,16,24 and 32 bit
		    graphics modes with bgr or rgb ordering
		  . recognizes tens of buggy graphics cards and VESA BIOSes
		    Extensions and avoids their bugs
		  . bit depth is choosen dynamically to get the best picture
		    available while still scrolling smoothly
		  . all of this still works on VGA card with 256KB of memory
		  . several bit depths can be disabled from commandline
		  . uses but doesn't depend on precise timing (which is not
		    available under Windows)
		  . interactive tests can be turned on in INI file,
		    without tests the engine can't use all gfx card features
		  . all sources are available in CiA library
		dmultilingualitya
		  . Machina and projects can support any language
		    with left-right letter and top-bottom line ordering
		  . Machina currently supports English and Czech.
		  . support in projects depends only on their makers.
		  . new languages can be easily added to Machina/projects
		dprogramabilitya
		  . objects written in ParLan language can live on pages
		  . objects can change page image
		  . objects can communicate with other objects and user
		  . objects can create new objects
		  . objects can watch and change behaviour of Machina
		  . objects can execute external programs
		  . objects can last when you turn Machina off and on
		dconfigurabilitya

		    when there is no 'next page', you return
		    (to be precise, when there is no 'next page', but some
		     links, nothing happens, which should draw your
		     attention to them)
		  . so there is not many right button clicks (going back)
		    when you dive too deep, returning is automatic
		  . almost everything can be done by mouse
		  . everything can be done by keyboard
		  . important functions are concentrated in F1 menu
